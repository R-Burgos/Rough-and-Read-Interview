What is an instance in object-oriented programming?,An instance is an object that is an instance of a class or type 
Explain the difference between class/static methods and instance methods,Class / Static Method: ClassName.MethodName( ) Instance Method: instanceOfAClass.MethodName() For example) repo.GetAllProducts(); An instance method applies to an instance of the class (i.e. an object) whereas a class method applies to the class itself. In C# a class method is marked static. Methods and properties not marked static are instance methods. 
When should you add an index to a database column? What is the cost of a database index?,When you want to read from the database faster.  The cost is that it takes more time to write information to the database 
You have a table called drivers and a table called orders.  Orders are delivered by drivers. In this way the orders belong to a driver through the column orders.driver_id.  Write a SQL expression that gets all the drivers that have delivered an order,SELECT * FROM drivers INNER JOIN orders on orders.driver_id = driver.id
Explain REST / RESTful Services:,Representational State Transfer is a language-independent architecture that provides interoperability between computer systems on the Internet.  It utilizes a stateless protocol aiming for fast performance and reliability.  POST GET PUT DELETE
What is fault tolerance?,enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of (or one or more faults within) some of its components 
Explain what an ORM does?,Object Relational Mapper is a software abstractor that is used to access a relational database from an object-oriented language. We used Dapper in this class
Difference between a Class and an Abstract Class?,An abstract class is intended to be a base class of other classes. It acts as a template for its derived classes. Abstract classes have the following features:- An abstract class cannot be instantiated.- An abstract class may contain abstract methods and accessors.- A non-abstract class derived from an abstract class must include actual implementations of all inherited abstract methods and accessors.
What is C#?,C# is a strongly and statically typed object-oriented programming language
Explain what a Class is in C#:,A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created 
What are the 4 pillars of OOP?,Inheritance. Polymorphism. Encapsulation. Abstraction.
What is Inheritance?,In OOP inheritance is the concept that a child class or type can inherit functionality from its parent. You can think of inheritance as a parent/child relationship.
What is Polymorphism?,(Having many forms) In OOP polymorphism is the concept that two or more different classes/types with differing implementations can be referenced or called in a similar fashion.
What is Encapsulation?,In OOP encapsulation is the concept that a class or type will only expose the functionality necessary to accomplish a given goal or hiding or encapsulating any remaining functionality.
What is Abstraction?,In OOP abstraction is the concept that software should be built in abstract sections that can be combined together into a cohesive whole as opposed to building code where everything is tightly coupled and difficult to break apart.
What is the advantage of using a reference type over a value type?,One benefit is that a reference type has the ability to grow or shrink in the amount of memory allocated to it. Classes are reference types and have the advantage of being able to utilize inheritance.  Structs which are value types cannot implement inheritance (they can conform to interfaces though)
